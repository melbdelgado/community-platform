## Creando un Dojo (o club local de programación)
- Each coding club in the system has a local organiser. You can log in as the test manager user (manager@example.com) to start a dojo too, which is easier.
- Go through "start a dojo" and follow the steps.
- When your dojo is awaiting verification you can approve it as the manager by going to "manage dojos" and finding your Dojo by the user email "manager@example.com". Make sure you select "unverified" when searching for it.

### Convirtiendose en champion/organizador de un Dojo existente
- Go to "manage dojos" and edit a listing of your choice. 
- You can update the listing founder to be manager@example.com and it will now show up under "My Dojos".

## Administrando tu Dojo
- When your Dojo is verified, you can view it in "My Dojos".
- Here you can edit your Dojo, and manage the events (tickets for your latest coding club events!).

## Creando un evento
- Go to "My Dojos" > "Manage events" > "Create Event" and follow the instructions

## Premiando con insignias
- Go to "My Dojos" > "Manage Users" > Under each user there is an "Award Badge" dropdown.

## Administrando Usuarios
- Go to "My Dojos" > "Manage Users"

### Administrando permisos
- When each user signs up they sign up with a particular type of profile: "champion"/"mentor"/"youth under 13"/"youth over 13"
- In "Manage Users" you can give them additional permissions.
- If they have "Dojo Admin" permissions ticked then they can award badges
- The "Ticketing Admin" permission gives them access to create and manage the events for the Dojo
- Adding the "Parent" user type will allow them to add children to their profile (even if they signed up with a different type of profile)
- Under 13 accounts can only be attached to their parents profile, wheras Over 13 accounts can log in and post on the forum.
